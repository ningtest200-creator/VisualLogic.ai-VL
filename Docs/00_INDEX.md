# VisualLogic Documentation

This documentation explains how to build full-stack applications with VisualLogic using AI-driven code generation and visual development tools.

------

## Getting Started

Start here to create your first project and understand how VisualLogic works.

- [Create a Project](getting-started/create-a-project.md)
- [Introduction and Workflow](getting-started/introduction-and-workflow.md)
- [Development Interaction Model](getting-started/development-interaction-model.md)
- [IDE Layout and Panels](getting-started/ide-layout-and-panels.md)
- [Mapping Between AI Files, Object Tree, Stage, and Event Panel](getting-started/Mapping Between AI Files, Object Tree, Stage, and Event Panel.md)

## Editor

This section documents the core panels of the VisualLogic IDE.

 Each article corresponds to a concrete part of the editor interface.

- [Stage](editor/stage.md)
- [Component Panel](editor/component-panel.md)
- [Object Tree](editor/object-tree.md)
- [Properties Panel](editor/properties-panel.md)
- [Event Panel](editor/event-panel.md)
- [Formula Editor](editor/formula-editor.md)
- [AI Files Panel](editor/AI Files Panel)

> Event logic such as actions, conditions, loops, and execution flow are documented inside **Event Panel**, not as separate systems.

## VL Language

The textual (code) representation of VisualLogic projects.

These documents are based on **VL Language Specification** and explain how visual structures map to VL code.

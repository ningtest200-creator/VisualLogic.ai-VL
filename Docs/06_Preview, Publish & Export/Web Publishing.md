- # Web Publishing

  Publishing an application to the web is a crucial step in the development process, enabling you to share your work with users. **Web Publishing** in VisualLogic simplifies the process of making your app accessible on the web.

  This guide will walk you through the steps involved in preparing your application for web publishing, configuring your domain, and deploying your app to a live environment.

  ------

  ## Steps to Publish Your Application to the Web

  Publishing your VisualLogic application to the web involves several key steps. Let's break it down:

  ### 1. **Build Your Application for Production**

  Before publishing your application, ensure it is ready for **production**. This includes:

  - **Testing the UI**: Ensure the design and functionality meet your expectations by using **Preview Mode** and **Debug Mode** to identify any issues.
  - **Optimizing Backend Services**: Make sure backend services are working correctly and efficiently. For instance, verify that data flows smoothly and services respond as expected.
  - **Final Check on Dependencies**: Ensure that all components (like images, fonts, and libraries) are included and functioning correctly.

  ------

  ### 2. **Configure Publishing Settings**

  Once your application is production-ready, you can configure the settings for web publishing:

  1. **Select the Web Platform**:
     - Choose the environment in which you want to publish your application. VisualLogic supports various platforms, and you can configure them according to your needs.
  2. **Set Up Versioning**:
     - Assign a **version number** to your release. This is particularly useful for tracking updates and ensuring that your production environment always runs the latest stable version.
  3. **Optimization for Web**:
     - VisualLogic automatically optimizes your application for the web. However, you can manually adjust settings like **resolution**, **UI scaling**, and **performance optimizations** (e.g., minifying assets, optimizing images).

  ------

  ### 3. **Domain Configuration**

  Once your application is ready for publishing, you need to configure the domain through which users will access your application.

  #### **Using the Default Public Domain**

  By default, VisualLogic provides a **public domain** for your application. If you're fine with using this **default domain**, your application will be live and accessible via a URL automatically generated by VisualLogic.

  - **Example URL**: `yourapp.visuallogic.com`
  - No further action is required if you are happy with this domain.

  #### **Custom Domain Configuration** (Recommended)

  If you prefer to use your own **custom domain** (e.g., `www.myapp.com`), you can follow these steps:

  1. **Purchase a Domain**:
     - Choose a **domain name** for your application from a domain registrar such as **GoDaddy**, **Namecheap**, or **Google Domains**.
  2. **Configure DNS Settings**:
     - In **VisualLogic**, go to the **Publish Panel** and select the **Domain Configuration** option.
     - Follow the instructions to update your **DNS records** (typically **A records** or **CNAME records**) to point to VisualLogic’s hosting environment.
     - **Important**: Once the DNS settings are configured, it might take up to **48 hours** for the changes to propagate.
  3. **Verify Domain Configuration**:
     - After configuring the DNS records, you can verify the setup by visiting your custom domain in a browser (e.g., `www.myapp.com`) to ensure that your application is accessible.
  4. **SSL Configuration (HTTPS)**:
     - For secure connections, configure **SSL** for your custom domain. VisualLogic supports **automatic SSL configuration** for custom domains, ensuring that your users access the app over a **secure HTTPS** connection.
     - You can also use third-party SSL providers like **Let’s Encrypt** for automatic SSL certificates.

  ### 4. **Publish the Application**

  Once the domain configuration is done, it's time to publish your application to the web. VisualLogic simplifies this process with the following steps:

  1. **Select Your Target Environment**:
     - In the **Publish Panel**, choose the environment where you want to deploy your application. VisualLogic allows you to publish to **staging**, **production**, or other custom environments.
  2. **Click the Publish Button**:
     - Once everything is set up, click the **Publish** button in the **Publish Panel**. VisualLogic will automatically:
       - Optimize and package the application.
       - Deploy it to the selected environment.
       - Bind the application to the configured domain.
  3. **Monitor Deployment**:
     - After publishing, VisualLogic provides deployment logs so you can monitor the process. Check for any errors or issues that may arise during deployment, and ensure the app is available online.

  ------

  ### 5. **Post-Publish Steps**

  After your application is live, it’s essential to monitor its performance and ensure everything is functioning as expected.

  #### **Key Post-Publish Tasks:**

  1. **Test Live Version**:
     - Access the live version of your application via the configured domain. Perform tests to ensure that everything is working as expected.
  2. **Monitor Performance**:
     - Use **performance monitoring tools** (e.g., **Google Analytics**, **New Relic**) to track user interactions, page load times, and other key metrics.
  3. **Check for Errors**:
     - Keep an eye on **error logs** and **user feedback**. If issues are detected (e.g., bugs, crashes), address them quickly with hotfixes or updates.
  4. **Handle Updates**:
     - For updates, VisualLogic allows you to **re-publish** your app easily. Just make the necessary changes, set the new version, and publish again.

  ## Benefits of Web Publishing with VisualLogic

  1. **Simple and Fast**:
     - The web publishing process in VisualLogic is designed to be **user-friendly** and **efficient**, allowing you to publish your app with just a few clicks.
  2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
     - Once published, your app will be accessible on **desktop** and **mobile browsers**, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.
  3. **Automatic Versioning**:
     - VisualLogic handles version control automatically, making sure that each update is properly tracked and versioned.
  4. **Optimized for Web**:
     - VisualLogic ensures your app is **optimized** for fast loading times and responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes.

  ------

  ## **Next Steps**

  After your application is successfully published, you can take the following actions:

  - **Monitor the Application**: Once the app is live, use **analytics** and **performance monitoring tools** to track its usage and ensure smooth user experiences.
  - **Handle Future Updates**: When you need to update or modify your application, make changes in VisualLogic, assign a new version number, and **re-publish** the app.
  - **Export and Self-Host (Optional)**: If you do not wish to use **VisualLogic’s cloud hosting**, you can **export** your application’s source code and deploy it on your own servers. This gives you full control over the environment, but you will be responsible for server management and infrastructure.

  For detailed instructions on how to **export and self-host**, refer to the **Export and Deployment** documentation.

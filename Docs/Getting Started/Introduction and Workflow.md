# Introduction and Workflow

> This document introduces what VisualLogic is and how developers work with it inside the IDE.

---

## What Is VisualLogic

VisualLogic is a **full-stack visual programming platform** that allows developers to build **complex applications without writing traditional code**, while still being able to export complete source code.

It is not a page builder and not a simple low-code tool.

VisualLogic is a **visual programming language with a complete integrated development environment (IDE)**.

---

## Why VisualLogic Is Different

Traditional application development usually requires:

- Writing large amounts of frontend and backend code
- Managing multiple programming languages and frameworks
- Manually designing system architecture
- Maintaining complex codebases

VisualLogic moves development to a **higher level of abstraction**.

Instead of writing code line by line, developers build applications by **connecting visual components and orchestrating logic graphically**.

---

## Component-Oriented Programming

At the core of VisualLogic is **Component-Oriented Programming**.

Each component encapsulates:

- Properties (state and configuration)
- Events (triggers)
- Actions (behavior)
- Internal logic

Applications are built by assembling and connecting these components visually.

This approach allows even complex systems to be expressed clearly and intuitively.

---

## Full-Stack Development Without Writing Code

VisualLogic supports complete full-stack development:

- Frontend UI and interaction logic
- Backend data models and business logic
- Communication between frontend and backend

All logic is created visually, but eventually compiled into **real executable code**.

VisualLogic can generate and export:

- Frontend source code (e.g. Vue / React)
- Backend source code (e.g. Java Spring Boot)
- Complete project structures

This ensures transparency, flexibility, and long-term maintainability.

## How Development Works in the IDE

When working in the VisualLogic IDE, development follows a clear and consistent workflow.

---

## Step 1: Create a Project

Development starts by creating a **Project**.

- Click the **+ Project** button in the IDE top toolbar
- Enter the project name
- The IDE creates a project group automatically

Each project represents a complete system.

---

## Step 2: Project Structure

After creation, the IDE automatically initializes:

- **One Backend Application**
  - Data, services, and business logic
- **One Frontend Application**
  - Pages, UI components, and interaction logic

A project can contain multiple frontend applications sharing the same backend.

---

## Step 3: Choose a Development Mode

VisualLogic supports two complementary development modes.

### Visual Development Mode

This is the core development mode, working inside the **dark-themed IDE workspace**, which includes:

- Stage (visual editing area)
- Component Panel
- Object Tree
- Properties Panel
- Event Panel
- VL Code Panel

Developers build applications by dragging components, configuring properties, and visually orchestrating logic.

No traditional coding is required.

---

### AI-Assisted Development Mode

VisualLogic also provides an AI development panel:

- Displayed by default in the **bottom-right corner**
- Developers input natural language instructions
- The AI generates corresponding logic or structures

This mode accelerates development and reduces repetitive work.

---

## Step 4: Build Logic Visually

Application behavior is defined using visual logic blocks:

- Events as triggers
- Actions as execution steps
- Conditions for decision making
- Loops for repeated logic
- Formula editors for expressions

These visual structures correspond to real programming constructs.

---

## Step 5: Preview, Iterate, and Export

During development, developers can:

- Preview applications instantly
- Adjust UI and logic visually
- Iterate rapidly

When ready, the complete project source code can be exported for independent deployment and maintenance.

---

## Who VisualLogic Is For

VisualLogic is designed for:

- Developers who want to build faster
- Teams reducing development complexity
- Non-programmers building real applications
- Enterprises requiring full control over source code

It bridges no-code simplicity with professional software engineering.

---

## Summary

- VisualLogic is a full-stack visual programming platform
- Development is based on components and visual logic
- Both visual and AI-assisted development are supported
- No traditional coding is required
- Complete source code can be generated and exported

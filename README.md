## 🚀 What is VisualLogic?

VisualLogic is a **full-stack AI programming system** built on a minimal, deterministic language called **VL (Visual Logic)**.

It enables:

- Natural language → full application generation
- Massively parallel multi-agent code generation
- True bidirectional transformation between code and visual graphs
- Deterministic AI output with ultra-low token cost

Unlike traditional low-code, no-code, or prompt-based systems:

> **VisualLogic is not a tool on top of code.  
> VisualLogic *is the programming system itself*.**

## 🧬 VL Language (Open Standard)

VL is a deterministic, low-entropy programming language optimized specifically for AI:

- Stable grammar
- No hidden state
- No formatting ambiguity
- Massive agent parallelism
- Ultra low token cost per generation

VL acts as the **intermediate representation (IR)** between:

- AI Models
- Visual IDE
- Real production code

> The Visual IDE is the 2D projection of VL.  
> The VL text is the 1D projection of the visual IDE.

## 🧩 Component-Oriented Programming

Everything in VisualLogic is a component:

- UI Components  
- Service Components  
- Database Components (VirtualTables)  
- Workflow Components  
- Agent Components  

This allows:

- True full-stack visual programming
- Unified logic across frontend, backend, and data
- AI-friendly structured generation

---

## 🤖 AI IDE + Workflow System

VisualLogic embeds a full workflow engine inside the AI IDE:

- Each Agent is configurable
- Each Agent uses Prompt IDs from a Prompt Document Center
- The entire Agent Workflow is defined as a JSON file
- The JSON itself can be generated and optimized by AI

This enables:

- Self-evolving AI development pipelines
- Human-in-the-loop debugging
- Deterministic multi-agent collaboration

---

## 🛠 Compiler & Runtime

VisualLogic provides:

- Online cloud compiler
- Local offline compiler
- Full-stack output:
  - Frontend: JavaScript
  - Backend: Java / Node
- Independent deployment
